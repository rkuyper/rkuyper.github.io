<h2>An Introduction to Orthogonal Polynomials</h2>
<span id='author'>Noud Aldenhoven</span>

<p><i>A little ($q$-)part of what every mathematician should know about orthogonal polynomials.</i></p>

<p>
An orthonormal polynomials sequence (OPS) is a sequence of polynomials, one for every degree $n \geq 0$, such that two different polynomials in the system are orthogonal to each other under some inner product.
The field of orthogonal polynomials was developed in the late 19th century and has many important application to Physics.
The talk starts with calculating the Jacobi Polynomials, a special kind of OPS. 
This example should motivate us to develop a more general theory of OPS.
In this talk some of the most basic properties of these OPS are described; the recurrence relation, Christoffel-Darboux identity, Favard's theorem, and maybe more.
Depending on the time that is left $q$-analogues of Jacobi Polynomials are discussed.

<p>This talk serves as an introduction to next week's talk.</p>
