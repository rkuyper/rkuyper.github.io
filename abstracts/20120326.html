<h2>Construction of free modal algebras &mdash; an application of duality theory</h2>
<span id='author'>Dion Coumans</span>

<p>
In the previous PhD colloquium, Sam van Gool discussed Stone duality 
for Boolean algebras and highlighted its significance to the study of 
classical propositional logic (CPL). As was illustrated, one may obtain 
information about CPL by studying free Boolean algebras and their dual 
Stone spaces. In general, for a given logic, an understanding of its 
(finitely generated) free algebras, may yield powerful results about the 
logic.
</p>

<p>
We will discuss an extension of classical propositional logic, namely 
modal logic. The algebras related to modal logic are modal algebras, 
that is, Boolean algebras extended with an additional unary operation. 
Finitely generated Boolean algebras are finite and easy to understand. 
However, in the setting of modal algebras, this is not the case in 
general. We describe a functorial method to construct finitely generated 
modal algebras as a colimit of a chain of finite partial modal algebras. 
An extension of Stone duality allows us to give a concrete description 
of the algebras in this chain approximating the free algebra. This 
construction may be applied, for example, to decide logical equivalence 
of formulas.
