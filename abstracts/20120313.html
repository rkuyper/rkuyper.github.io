<h2>Sheaves and duality in propositional logics</h2>
<span id='author'>Sam van Gool</span>

<p>
Stone duality for Boolean algebras is a basic tool in semantics for propositional logics. Our starting point will be the observation that, with hindsight, Stone's representation theorem for Boolean algebras (1936) is a special case of the fact that any ring is isomorphic to the global sections of its structure sheaf. The Stone dual space of a Boolean algebra is the base space of its structure sheaf. We discuss recent generalizations of this sheaf representation to the category of MV algebras (equivalently, l-groups with strong order unit). These algebras are of interest to logicians because they are associated to non-classical, multivalued ≈Åukasiewicz logic (Dubuc, Poveda 2011). We will end by sketching the connection to the Stone dual space of these algebras (Gehrke, van Gool, Marra, forthcoming).
