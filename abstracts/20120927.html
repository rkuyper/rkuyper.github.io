<h2>An Introduction to the Classifying Topos</h2>
<span id='author'>Sander Wolters</span>

<p>
Topos theory is neat as it unifies logic and set theory on the one hand, and topology on the other hand. An introduction to topos theory that makes this claim precise would be the subject of (at least) a one semester course rather than a one hour talk. However, in the notion of a classifying topos both the topological perspective and the logical perspective of topos theory come together in a nice way. As an example consider rings, familiar from undergraduate algebra. Given any topos (which is a certain type of category) we can talk about rings in this topos just like rings in the category of sets. In a strong sense a topos is like a category of sets, and we can do mathematics in a topos like we do in sets.
</p>

<p>
There is a special topos, called the classifying topos of the theory of rings, and a special ring in this topos, which has the following property. Any ring in any topos (in particular rings made from sets) can be obtained from this one special ring by the action of a suitable inverse image functor (which is a lot like the inverse image of a continuous function). If we think of a topos as a generalized topological space (which is not weird as I shall argue) then rings in topoi are equivalent to continuous maps to this classifying "space".
</p>

<p>
We can do the same for local rings, groups and a lot of other structures. neat huh? I hope to make the above more clear and precise in my talk, or at the very least give an impression of what a topos is. For those of you who have seen Eilenberg-Mac Lane spaces, the notion of a classifying topos is similair. For those of you that are familiar with the Lindenbaum algebra of a classical propositional theory, if we think of this Boolean algebra as a topological space by Stone duality, then this space is a lot like a classifying topos.
</p>

<p>
As prerequisites I assume some basic knowledge of category theory. You should be familiar with categories, functors, natural transformations, products, pullbacks and not be scared of adjunctions.
